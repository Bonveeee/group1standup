#Methods are expressions that return a value, equivalent to JavaScript functions.
#2 types of methods : Instance methods and Class methods.
#method name, by convention, must be in lower case.
#methods have an implicit return, whatever is on the last line.

#class Members
		
#	def greet(name)
#		puts "Hi #{name}"
#	end
#end

#member1  = Members.new
#member2 = Members.new
#puts member2
#puts member1
#puts member1.greet("Ben")



##Implicit return and return keyword 

#def greet_me
#	"Using return keyword stopped execution at this line"
#	"Hi Ben"
#end

#puts greet_me
